# Bearing_Diagnostics
This project will keep updating.
- This is a project to diagnose bearing faults using machine learning techniques. The demo files uses ***Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Set***. The full dataset can be downloaded from the ***data.zip*** file in the repository.
- Before running the model_train.ipynb file, please make sure that you have ran the **data_create.ipynb** file to create the train_data and label datasets.
- Then run the **model_train.ipynb** file to train the models.
- On the first upload of this repository, the **model_train.ipynb** file contains RandomForest and SVM models to diagnose bearing faults. I will update the file with more traditional machine-learning models in the future.
- It is also in plan to implement deep learning models(CNN, LSTM, Transformer...) to diagnose bearing faults in the future.
## Before running the model_train.ipynb file
- Please make sure you have installed the following libraries:
```
numpy,tensorflow,sckit-learn,pandas,matplotlib,pytorch,scipy,collections
```
- If you have not installed the libraries, you can install them using the following command:
```
pip install numpy tensorflow sckit-learn pandas matplotlib pytorch scipy collections
```
